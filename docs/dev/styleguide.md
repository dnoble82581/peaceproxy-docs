# Style Guide

## PHP/Laravel
- Repositories for DB access, Services for business logic
- DTOs for transport; avoid passing arrays around
- Named routes; avoid hardcoded URLs

## Livewire/Volt
- Keep components small and focused
- Use loading states and pagination
- Prefer backend‑driven presence/events

## Tailwind v4
- Utility‑first classes; extract components in Blade/Volt when reused
- Dark mode: `class` strategy

## Commits & PRs
- Conventional Commits
- PR template: description, screenshots, migration notes
