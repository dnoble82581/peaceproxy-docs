## Understanding Messages in PeaceProxy

Messages are the core communication units within the PeaceProxy platform, enabling real-time information exchange during
crisis negotiations and incident management. Each message is securely transmitted, permanently logged, and designed to
support effective team communication in high-stakes situations.

## Message Types

PeaceProxy supports four distinct message types, each serving a specific communication purpose:

### ðŸ”¹ Regular Messages

Regular messages are standard communications visible to all participants in a conversation. These messages:

- Form the foundation of team communication
- Are visible to all conversation participants
- Support text, formatting, and file attachments
- Create a chronological record of discussions

### ðŸ”¹ Alert Messages

Alert messages are designed to draw immediate attention to important information. These messages:

- Are visually highlighted with amber/yellow styling
- Indicate urgent but non-emergency information
- Help emphasize key points that shouldn't be missed
- Are useful for time-sensitive updates or important reminders

To send an alert message:

1. Compose your message in the chat input area
2. Click the alert icon (bell symbol) in the message toolbar
3. Send the message as usual

### ðŸ”¹ Emergency Messages

Emergency messages represent the highest priority communication and are used for critical situations requiring immediate
attention. These messages:

- Are prominently displayed with red styling and borders
- Are prefixed with "[EMERGENCY]" in the message content
- May trigger additional notifications depending on system configuration
- Should be used only for genuine emergencies or critical safety information

To send an emergency message:

1. Compose your message in the chat input area
2. Click the emergency icon (exclamation mark) in the message toolbar
3. Send the message as usual

### ðŸ”¹ Whisper Messages

Whisper messages are private communications visible only to the sender and a specific recipient, even within group
conversations. These messages:

- Allow for private side conversations without creating separate chats
- Are styled distinctly (typically with purple/indigo coloring)
- Can only be seen by the sender and the designated recipient
- Are useful for sensitive clarifications or one-on-one guidance

To send a whisper message:

1. Compose your message in the chat input area
2. Click the whisper icon (speech bubble) in the message toolbar
3. Select the recipient from the participant list
4. Send the message as usual

## Creating and Sending Messages

### Basic Message Composition

To send a standard message:

1. Navigate to the desired conversation
2. Click in the message input area at the bottom of the chat
3. Type your message
4. Press Enter or click the send button to transmit your message

### Message Formatting

PeaceProxy supports basic text formatting in messages:

- **Bold text**: Use asterisks (*bold*)
- *Italic text*: Use underscores (_italic_)
- ~~Strikethrough~~: Use tildes (~strikethrough~)
- `Code snippets`: Use backticks (`code`)
- Bulleted lists: Start lines with hyphens (-)
- Numbered lists: Start lines with numbers (1., 2., etc.)

### File Attachments

To attach files to messages:

1. Click the attachment icon (paperclip) in the message toolbar
2. Select the file from your device
3. Add an optional description for the file
4. Complete your message text if needed
5. Send the message with the attachment

Supported file types include:

- Documents (.pdf, .docx, .xlsx, etc.)
- Images (.jpg, .png, .gif)
- Audio files (.mp3, .wav)
- Other formats based on your agency's configuration

## Message Management

### Editing Messages

Depending on your permissions and agency settings, you may be able to edit your messages:

1. Hover over the message you wish to edit
2. Click the edit icon (pencil)
3. Make your changes
4. Press Enter or click Save to update the message

Note: Edited messages are marked as "edited" for transparency.

### Deleting Messages

To delete a message you've sent:

1. Hover over the message
2. Click the delete icon (trash can)
3. Confirm the deletion when prompted

Note: Depending on your agency's settings, deleted messages may still be preserved in system logs for compliance
purposes.

### Message Reactions

You can quickly respond to messages with reactions:

1. Hover over a message
2. Click the reaction icon (emoji)
3. Select from available reactions or add a custom emoji

Reactions provide a way to acknowledge messages without sending additional text responses.

## Best Practices for Effective Messaging

### When to Use Each Message Type

- **Regular Messages**: For standard communication and information sharing
- **Alert Messages**: For important information that requires attention but isn't critical
- **Emergency Messages**: Only for critical situations requiring immediate action
- **Whisper Messages**: For private communications that should remain between two individuals

### Communication Guidelines

1. **Be Clear and Concise**: Keep messages focused and to the point
2. **Use Appropriate Urgency**: Reserve alert and emergency messages for truly important communications
3. **Maintain Professionalism**: Remember that all messages are logged and may be reviewed later
4. **Consider Visibility**: Be mindful of who can see your messages, especially in public conversations
5. **Use Structured Information**: For complex updates, use formatting to improve readability
6. **Acknowledge Receipt**: Use reactions to indicate you've seen important messages

## Message Security and Compliance

All messages in PeaceProxy are:

- End-to-end encrypted for maximum security
- Permanently logged for accountability and record-keeping
- Timestamped for accurate chronological documentation
- Attributable to specific users for accountability
- Compliant with law enforcement data protection standards

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with messaging:

- **Message not sending**: Check your network connection and refresh the application
- **Formatting not working**: Ensure you're using the correct syntax for formatting
- **File upload issues**: Verify the file is an allowed type and size
- **Message visibility problems**: Confirm that you have the necessary permissions for the conversation
