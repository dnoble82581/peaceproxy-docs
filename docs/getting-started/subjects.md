# Subjects

## Overview

Subjects are individuals who are the focus of negotiations in the PeaceProxy application. They can be suspects, persons in crisis, hostage-takers, or other individuals with whom negotiators need to communicate. Subjects are central to the negotiation process and have various attributes and relationships that help negotiators understand and interact with them effectively.

## What is a Subject?

In PeaceProxy, a subject represents an individual who is the focus of a negotiation. Subjects have:

- **Status**: Indicates the subject's current status in a negotiation
- **Risk Factors**: Identified risk factors associated with the subject
- **Images**: Photos or other visual identifiers

## Relationships

Subjects have relationships with several other entities in the system:

- **Tenant**: Each subject belongs to a tenant (organization)
- **Negotiations**: Subjects can be involved in multiple negotiations with different roles
- **Risk Assessments**: Evaluations of risk factors related to the subject
- **Demands**: Requests or requirements made by the subject
- **Warnings**: Cautions or alerts about the subject

**Note**: Deleting a subject will not remove their associated data, such as negotiations they've been involved in or risk assessments conducted about them. Instead, the subject will be marked as inactive and will no longer appear in active subject lists.

## Subject Mood Tracking

PeaceProxy allows tracking of a subject's mood over time:

1. Navigate to the subject's profile
2. Locate the "Mood" section
3. Update the current mood using the provided scale
4. Add notes about the mood change if needed

The system will maintain a log of mood changes, which can help negotiators understand patterns and trends in the subject's emotional state.

## Risk Factors

Subjects can have various risk factors associated with them:

- **Mental Health Issues**: Depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, etc.
- **Substance Abuse**: Alcohol, drugs, or other substances
- **History of Violence**: Past violent behavior or threats
- **Access to Weapons**: Known possession of firearms or other weapons
- **Suicidal Ideation**: Thoughts or threats of self-harm

These risk factors help negotiators assess the potential dangers and develop appropriate strategies.

## Integration with Other Components

Subjects integrate with several other components of the PeaceProxy application:

- **Negotiations**: Subjects are the focus of negotiations
- **Users**: Users interact with subjects through negotiations
- **Assessments**: Risk assessments are conducted about subjects
- **Settings**: Tenant settings can affect how subject information is displayed and managed
