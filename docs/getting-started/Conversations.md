## What Are Conversations?

Conversations in PeaceProxy are secure communication channels that enable real-time exchange of information between team
members during crisis negotiations and incident management. They provide structured, documented communication that
supports effective team coordination and creates a permanent record of all interactions.

## Types of Conversations

PeaceProxy supports three distinct conversation types to accommodate different communication needs:

### ðŸ”¹ Private Conversations

Private conversations are one-on-one exchanges between two team members. These conversations:

- Allow for confidential discussions between specific individuals
- Support direct coordination between roles (e.g., negotiator and commander)
- Provide a space for sensitive information sharing
- Enable mentoring and guidance without broader visibility

### ðŸ”¹ Group Conversations

Group conversations include multiple participants and are designed for team-based communication. These conversations:

- Facilitate coordination among specific functional teams
- Allow for specialized discussions (e.g., tactical planning, psychological assessment)
- Support role-based communication groups
- Enable focused collaboration on specific aspects of the incident

### ðŸ”¹ Public Conversations

Public conversations are visible to all authorized personnel involved in a negotiation. These conversations:

- Serve as the primary channel for team-wide updates
- Provide situational awareness to all team members
- Document critical developments for the entire response team
- Create a comprehensive chronological record of the incident

## Who Can Create Conversations?

The ability to create conversations is determined by user roles and permissions:

- **Negotiation Leads** can create all conversation types
- **Team Supervisors** can create group and private conversations for their team members
- **Negotiators** can typically create private conversations with other team members
- **Command Staff** can create conversations based on operational needs
- **System Administrators** can create any conversation type

Your specific permissions are determined by your agency's configuration and your assigned role within the system.

   communication
